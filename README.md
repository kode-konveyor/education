# The basic process

we put up units to be developed with "up for grab" and "in progress" labels
content providers can propose a unit with a pull request, mentioning the above issue
the pull request should contain a change to the "units" file, mentioning the URL to the developed unit in moodle

reviewers should create issues with "concern" tag, mentioning the pull request
we either close a concern, or add "valid" tag to it

we consider a unit for inclusin if it does not have valid concerns on it, so the content provider should work on improving the unit around those concerns, and comment on the concern when it is okay.
The reviewer should monitor those concerns, and tag it "addressed" when the concern is adeuately addressed.
You do not close the issue, we do it.
